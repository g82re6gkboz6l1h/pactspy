## The Journey of Software Testing Evolution

Software testing has undergone dramatic changes since its inception. The manual-testing era relied on step-by-step execution, which struggled to match the speed and complexity of modern software development. The advent of automated testing frameworks like Selenium and Appium helped maximize efficiency, though frequent script updates and coding overhead remained challenges.

By 2025, advanced technologies are closing those gaps. Testing is now a collaborative, development-centric effort featuring predictive intelligence, real-time analytics, and adaptable systems.
