## Why AI is Essential for Software Testing

Software testing is an integral stage in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), helping ensure applications deliver on performance, security, and usability. However, traditional testing often faces challenges in keeping pace with agile workflows, escalating application complexities, and the growing demand for continuous deployment.

Artificial intelligence offers a solution with its capacity to automate repetitive tasks, analyze large datasets, and adapt through machine learning. This results in less human error, faster defect detection, and superior scalability, making AI-powered tools indispensable for future software testing.
