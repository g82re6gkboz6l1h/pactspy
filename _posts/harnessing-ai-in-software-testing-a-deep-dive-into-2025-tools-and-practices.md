## What is AI’s Role in Modern Software Testing?

AI brings unprecedented automation and decision-making in testing, tackling challenges like scalability, complexity, and real-time monitoring. Here's how:

### 1. **Automated Test Case Creation**
AI tools automate test case generation via behavior analysis and risk evaluation. This eliminates manual inefficiencies while optimizing test coverage.

### 2. **Predictive Bug Prevention**
Platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) predict errors before they occur by analyzing historical data, user feedback, and even application logs in early development phases.

### 3. **Real-Time Monitoring and Self-Healing**
Advanced AI-driven systems conduct continuous application monitoring, predicting issues before they impact users and implementing self-healing mechanisms dynamically.
