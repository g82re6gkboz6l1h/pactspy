## Key Challenges for QA Teams in 2025

### 1. Leveraging AI Testing Tools such as Zof AI
AI-powered tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) are transforming QA by automating monotonous tasks, predicting bugs, and enabling smarter testing. However, integrating these tools requires overcoming barriers:
- Disruption of existing workflows.
- Interpreting AI algorithms effectively.
- Managing large-scale test data demands.
- Compatibility with outdated legacy systems.

### 2. Balancing Automation with Human Expertise
While automation streamlines many testing processes, human testers play a crucial role in:
- **Creative exploratory testing:** Discovering edge cases that automation cannot.
- **Ethical evaluations:** Mitigating biases in AI algorithms.
- **Inclusive testing:** Designing systems that cater to diverse user needs.
