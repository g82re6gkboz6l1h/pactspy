## What is Continuous Testing?

Continuous Testing involves the automated execution of tests throughout the software delivery pipeline, delivering ongoing feedback about business risks and software functionality. But it goes beyond detecting bugs—it ensures stability, reliability, and performance, enabling rapid iterations without compromising quality.

Key aspects of CT include:

1. **Automation:** Tests run alongside development and deployment without manual intervention.
2. **Integrated Workflows:** CT is embedded directly into CI/CD pipelines, reducing the gap between testing and delivery.
3. **Real-Time Feedback:** Frequent testing enables fast issue identification, empowering teams to resolve potential problems quickly.

CT replaces the outdated “testing phase” with a continuous, adaptive process. However, the future demands smarter methods—enter AI-driven tools such as [Zof AI](https://zof.ai). These technologies bring intelligent automation, reshaping CT dynamics.
