## Why AI-Driven Testing Will Dominate in 2025

The software industry is evolving, with traditional QA methods struggling to keep up due to:

- **Faster software release cycles** driven by Agile and DevOps practices.
- **Increasing complexity** from multi-cloud systems, API integrations, and advanced logic.
- **High stakes** in industries like healthcare, finance, and automotive, where software failures can have severe consequences.

AI testing introduces machine learning to improve test coverage, uncover hidden bugs, and align with rapid development cycles. [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) is leading this paradigm shift toward smarter, automated QA.
