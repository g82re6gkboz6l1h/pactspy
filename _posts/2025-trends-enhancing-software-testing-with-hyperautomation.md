## What is Hyperautomation and Its Role in Software Testing?

Hyperautomation is the evolution of automation technology, integrating AI, machine learning (ML), and robotic process automation (RPA). This cutting-edge approach empowers systems to adapt and optimize processes autonomously. Unlike traditional automation, hyperautomation enables complex workflows and intelligent decision-making at scale.

In software testing, hyperautomation bridges the gap between manual processes and rigid traditional frameworks. It allows QA teams to automate end-to-end testing, analyze large datasets, predict potential failures, and proactively recommend improvements. This powerful approach accelerates development cycles while enhancing product quality.
