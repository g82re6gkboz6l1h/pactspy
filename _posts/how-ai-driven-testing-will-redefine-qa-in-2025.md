## What is AI-Driven Testing?

AI-driven testing leverages machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics to automate and enhance QA processes. Unlike traditional manual testing, AI tests codebases intelligently, predicts areas prone to defects, and generates test cases automatically, significantly reducing human dependency. Learn how tools like **Zof AI** analyze datasets to streamline testing strategies, prioritize critical issues, and track application health at scale, driving faster, more accurate results.
