Skill #5: Collaboration and Adaptability in Agile Teams

In an agile, DevOps-driven world, effective collaboration is a must. Testers are expected to work closely with developers, operations teams, and product managers. Tools like Jira, Trello, and Slack will continue to facilitate teamwork.

Adaptability to changing requirements and openness to acquiring new skills will serve testers well in dynamic environments. Excellent communication, problem-solving abilities, and understanding the broader product lifecycle ensure that testers remain aligned with project goals and deliver successful results.
