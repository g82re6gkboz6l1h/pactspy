## What Is Agile Testing?

Agile testing ensures quality from start to finish in software development, following an iterative and collaborative approach. Unlike conventional testing as a separate phase, agile testing is continuous, emphasizing early issue identification and seamless adaptation to project changes.

### Core Features of Agile Testing

1. **Continuous Integration and Testing:** Frequent integration and prompt testing catch issues early, preventing long-term problems.
2. **Team Collaboration:** Agile testing thrives on open communication, involving developers, testers, and stakeholders for shared ownership of quality.
3. **Test Automation:** Automation tools expedite repetitive tasks, keeping pace with the rapid iterations of agile workflows.
4. **Adaptability:** Agile testing prioritizes flexibility, facilitating quick responses to shifting project requirements.

While essential, these principles can bring complexities that impede productivity in fast-paced environments. **Zof AI**, an AI-powered platform, addresses this challenge by simplifying agile testing workflows with cutting-edge features.
