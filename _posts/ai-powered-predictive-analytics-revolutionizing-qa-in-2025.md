## What Are Predictive Analytics in Testing?

Predictive analytics uses machine learning algorithms, statistical models, and historical patterns to forecast potential outcomes. In software testing, this means identifying defects, performance bottlenecks, and vulnerabilities before they materialize.

AI-powered systems like Zof AI analyze test cycle data to detect trends and prioritize efforts. These tools efficiently allocate resources, preemptively address risks, and streamline workflows. Predictive models help pinpoint modules prone to failure, enabling targeted testing and reducing reactive fixes.
