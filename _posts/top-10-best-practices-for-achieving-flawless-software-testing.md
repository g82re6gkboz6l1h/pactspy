## Steps to Clear Testing Goals That Align With Users

Clear objectives are the backbone of any software testing approach. Define:

- **Core functionalities to test**.
- **Success metrics for accuracy** (e.g., defect detection rates).
- **Alignment with user expectations** through targeted testing.

Clear testing goals ensure users receive reliable results that enhance experience.
