## What is Predictive Analytics in Software Testing?

Predictive analytics uses AI, ML, and statistical models to analyze patterns, forecast outcomes, and anticipate risks in software systems. Within QA, these systems leverage historical testing data, system logs, and performance metrics to anticipate issues before they appear.

**Advantages:**
- Early risk identification.
- Enhanced test coverage and precision.
- Reduced time-to-market.

For example, predictive analytics might highlight modules at risk of failure, recommending refactoring or intensified testing to avoid costly delays.
