## Software Testing Through the Years: Key Milestones

Since its inception, software testing has evolved in tandem with technological progress. Early software testing practices in the 1980s and 1990s heavily relied on manual processes. QA teams wrote test scripts manually to validate basic functionality. Enter the 2000s, and test automation tools like Selenium and QTP helped streamline repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing errors.

Agile development and CI/CD pipelines during the 2010s prioritized frequent test cycles and seamless software delivery. QA shifted from being a standalone phase to an integral part of development. However, advancing technologies like AI, IoT, and blockchain raised new challenges, necessitating scalable and smart testing solutions.

By 2025, the landscape has changed dramatically, with AI-powered solutions becoming a cornerstone of quality assurance practices. Testing has moved beyond manual processes, embracing tools that reduce complexity and automate tasks intelligently.
