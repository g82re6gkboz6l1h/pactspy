## The AI Transformation in Software Testing

Software testing has traditionally required significant manual effort to detect bugs, validate functionality, and optimize user experiences. While automation testing brought efficiency, it’s limited by predefined rules and scripts, which fail to adapt to changing requirements. By harnessing AI advancements like machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics, tools like Zof AI can dynamically adapt to requirements, predict vulnerabilities, and automate workflows. This ensures faster testing cycles, reduced errors, and scalable solutions for growing systems.
