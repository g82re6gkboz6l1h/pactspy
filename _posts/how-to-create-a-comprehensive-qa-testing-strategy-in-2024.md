## What Is a QA Testing Strategy?

A QA testing strategy is a structured framework designed to ensure high-quality software performance and reliability before its release. With clearly defined objectives, methodologies, tools, and timelines, it is vital for detecting and resolving software defects early in the lifecycle.

### Essential Components of a QA Strategy:
- **Set Clear Objectives and Scope**: Identify which features or workflows to test.
- **Choose the Right Testing Tools**: Use automation platforms like Zof AI to test effectively.
- **Define Testing Types**: Functional, security, regression, performance, and more.
- **Document the Process**: Maintain detailed reporting and notes about completed tests.

In 2024, adaptability is a must, with an emphasis on harnessing AI-powered tools to keep up with rapid software evolution.
