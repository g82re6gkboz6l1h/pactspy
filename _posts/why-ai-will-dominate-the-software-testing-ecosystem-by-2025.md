## How AI is Disrupting Traditional Software Testing

Traditional software testing relies heavily on manual or semi-automated processes, which are often time-consuming and unable to scale effectively. AI changes the game by introducing intelligent automation that improves defect detection, test coverage, and predictive analytics. This allows QA engineers to focus on critical tasks while automating repetitive functions.

AI tools such as [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) leverage machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to streamline workflows, reduce human error, and enable smarter decision-making in real time. As AI systems continuously learn from historical data, they evolve and provide increasingly accurate insights.
