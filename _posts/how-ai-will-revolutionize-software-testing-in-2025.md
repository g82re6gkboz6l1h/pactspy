## Addressing Traditional Testing Challenges
### 1. **Manual Testing Inefficiency**
Manual testing consumes significant time and resources. As applications grow in complexity, the volume of testing required becomes overwhelming.

### 2. **Cost Constraints**
The repetitive nature of manual testing leads to increased expenses for test management and maintenance.

### 3. **Human Error and Limited Accuracy**
Manual processes are prone to oversight and inconsistency, particularly for intricate or edge-case evaluations.

### 4. **Scalability Issues**
Conventional testing struggles to scale effectively, especially for organizations pursuing CI/CD pipelines.

### 5. **Feedback Delays**
The time lag in analyzing test results and identifying defects slows down development cycles significantly.

AI-powered quality assurance techniques eliminate these limitations via automation and actionable analytics.
