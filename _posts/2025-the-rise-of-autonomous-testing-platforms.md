## What Is Autonomous Testing? Why the Momentum?

Autonomous testing leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to conduct software testing without human intervention. Unlike traditional automated testing requiring manual scripting and maintenance, autonomous platforms evolve dynamically through intelligent algorithms. These systems adapt to modern software complexities, identify issues proactively, and deliver unparalleled accuracy, faster results, and scalability.

The surge in demand for autonomous testing stems from increasingly complex software ecosystems, accelerated release cycles, and the pressure to deliver high-quality products quickly. Traditional testing methods frequently fail to match these demands due to human oversight, repetitive script maintenance, and limitations in scalability.

Tech forecasts predict that, by 2025, over 70% of enterprises will adopt AI-driven testing to stay competitive. This shift highlights the disruptive potential of platforms like Zof AI to redefine the landscape of software development.
