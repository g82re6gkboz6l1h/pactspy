## What is Agile Testing?

Agile Testing is a QA methodology aligned with Agile principles, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and continuous testing throughout the development lifecycle. Unlike traditional testing, which begins after development, Agile testing is integrated into every sprint, supporting faster bug fixes and iteration.

### Essential Features of Agile Testing:

- **Test Automation**: Leveraging tools to run automated tests for iterative features.
- **Flexibility & Adaptability**: Continually refining tests as project requirements evolve.
- **Collaborative Workflow**: QA engineers and developers working hand-in-hand.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate identification and resolution of issues.

However, the increasing pace of Agile can make manual testing unsustainable. Incorporating AI-powered tools like Zof AI simplifies resource allocation and enables rapid, efficient processes at scale.
