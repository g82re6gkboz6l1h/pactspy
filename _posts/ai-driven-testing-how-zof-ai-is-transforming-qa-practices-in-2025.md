## The Role of AI in Modern Software Testing

Traditionally, software testing was a labor-intensive endeavor. While basic automation addressed repetitive tasks, it struggled with adapting to dynamic code changes and unforeseen scenarios. Enter AI in software testing, which leverages algorithms to analyze vast datasets, predict user behavior, dynamically update test cases, and mimic real-world usage.

AI-powered testing goes beyond simple automation by utilizing deep learning to identify hidden bugs, prioritize solutions, and minimize human intervention.
