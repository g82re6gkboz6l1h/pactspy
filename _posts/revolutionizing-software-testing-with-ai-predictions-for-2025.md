## The Evolution of Software Testing

Software testing has progressed from manual inspection to highly automated systems. Historically, manual testers identified bugs, but increasing software complexity prompted the rise of automation tools for repetitive tasks. Agile and DevOps practices expanded testing to continuous cycles, integrating automation with CI/CD pipelines.

Despite automation enhancing efficiency, traditional tools required predefined scripts and struggled with unpredictable scenarios. Enter AI—a technology that adapts dynamically, predicts failures, and proactively improves testing processes. By deploying machine learning, software testing is no longer reactive but predictive, enabling organizations to meet growing user demands and technology innovations.
