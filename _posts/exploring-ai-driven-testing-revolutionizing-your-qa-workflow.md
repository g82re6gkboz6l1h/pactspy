## What is AI-Driven Testing?

AI-driven testing uses artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) technologies to enhance and automate traditional software testing tasks, including test generation, execution, maintenance, and reporting. Instead of relying solely on reactive systems, AI introduces proactive mechanisms by spotting issues, suggesting solutions, and improving test coverage using adaptive learning.

Through analyzing historical data, AI-driven systems can predict application behaviors, detect patterns, and enhance the precision of testing processes. Over time, these systems become smarter, optimizing testing strategies and making processes more efficient.

By integrating AI into your QA process, organizations can ensure high-quality application releases while reducing costs and achieving faster time-to-market.
