## Introduction to AI in Software Testing

Historically, software testing has been labor-intensive, prone to human error during repetitive tasks. Automation testing improved efficiency but still demands significant human input. Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing testing by leveraging natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning algorithms to autonomously identify bugs, optimize test cases, and predict vulnerabilities in software.

The adoption of AI in QA is driven by increasing application complexity, AI-based development tools, and demand for faster releases. Tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) are leading this transformation, delivering smart, automated testing solutions that enhance quality assurance.
