## What is AI-driven QA Automation?
AI-driven QA automation leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) to enhance software testing. This methodology supersedes manual testing by dynamically adapting to code changes, predicting problems, generating intelligent test scripts, and offering advanced scalability. Transitioning QA from repetitive manual tasks to smart automated processes, AI reshapes how technology professionals ensure quality in software development.

Game-changing AI Tools - Zof AI Leads the Race
Top-notch tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) are spearheading innovations in QA automation, enabling organizations to efficiently conduct testing. Here’s why Zof AI has redefined software testing in 2025:
