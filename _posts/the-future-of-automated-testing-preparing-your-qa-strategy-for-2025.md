## Why Automated Testing Is a Must for 2025

By 2025, automation isn’t optional—it’s essential. As applications grow complex with microservices, API advancements, and feature interconnections, manual testing becomes increasingly inefficient. Modern agility demands tools capable of testing evolving software environments in real-time. Leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to automate test processes, deliver faster, and maintain code quality for a seamless user experience.
