## What Is AI-Powered Software Testing?

AI-powered software testing leverages AI and machine learning algorithms to automate and enhance the software testing lifecycle. Traditional software testing methods are often manual, repetitive, and time-consuming. Automation tools simplified the process to some extent, but AI-powered tools now take it even further. Unlike conventional systems, AI mimics human intelligence, processes massive data, and predicts potential flaws with exceptional precision.

### Key Features of AI-Powered Testing:
1. **Adaptive Testing:** AI tools adapt dynamically to code changes, addressing issues in real-time.
2. **Predictive Analytics:** Analyze historical testing data to identify future performance bottlenecks.
3. **Autonomous Test Execution:** Automated test scripts self-update for changing codebases.
4. **Edge Case Detection:** Identifies edge cases to eliminate overlooked critical errors.

This emerging approach ensures faster, smarter, and more reliable software development while reducing costs significantly.
