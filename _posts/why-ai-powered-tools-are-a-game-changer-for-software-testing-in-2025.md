## 1. Why Traditional Testing Methods Are Falling Behind

Traditional testing can no longer meet the demands of modern software development. Key limitations include:

- **Time-Intensive Process**: Manual testing consumes excessive time and is prone to errors.
- **Lack of Flexibility**: Static test scripts fail to adapt to evolving software ecosystems.
- **Scaling Challenges**: Conventional frameworks struggle with complex, large-scale applications.
- **Late Bug Detection**: Errors are often discovered late in the cycle, driving up costs.
- **Reactive Nature**: Traditional testing practices lack prediction and prevention capabilities.

These shortfalls have paved the way for smarter, faster, and adaptive AI-powered solutions, providing a necessary upgrade to legacy testing approaches.
