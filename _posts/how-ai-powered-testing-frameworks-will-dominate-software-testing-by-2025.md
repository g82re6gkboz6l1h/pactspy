## How AI Redefines Software Testing Frameworks

AI isn't just improving traditional testing methods; it's completely transforming them. Classic frameworks depended on manual input and static rules, which aren't suited for today's intricate systems. Here’s what AI brings to the table:

1. **Self-Learning Testing**:
   Using machine learning (ML) models, AI tools learn system behavior and user interaction patterns, detecting flaws dynamically without human input.

2. **Automated Test Case Generation**:
   AI tools craft test cases automatically by studying an application’s data, unlike traditional systems relying on manually written scripts.

3. **Seamless Continuous Testing**:
   In Agile and DevOps contexts, AI speeds up testing in continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, assisting teams with rapid iterations.

4. **Intelligent Test Maintenance**:
   AI autonomously updates test scripts when codebases change, reducing the labor associated with maintaining test cases manually.
