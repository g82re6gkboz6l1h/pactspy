## What is Software Testing?

Software testing involves evaluating applications to verify functionality, detect bugs, and ensure quality. Testing occurs at different lifecycle stages:

- **Unit Testing**: Tests individual components.
- **Integration Testing**: Examines component interactions.
- **System Testing**: Verifies overall system performance.
- **Acceptance Testing**: Ensures the product meets user needs.

### Challenges in Traditional Testing

1. **Time-Consuming**: Manual test case execution takes significant time.
2. **Error-Prone**: Human oversight leads to missed bugs.
3. **Limited Coverage**: Lack of automation limits scenarios tested.
4. **Costly**: High resource consumption.
