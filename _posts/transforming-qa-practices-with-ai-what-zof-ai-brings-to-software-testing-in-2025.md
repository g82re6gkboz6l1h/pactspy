## Introduction: The Evolution of QA Practices

In its early days, QA focused on labor-intensive manual tests, requiring QA engineers to spend hours creating test cases and checking software performance. However, these practices were inefficient and often error-prone. Over time, automation tools like Selenium and JUnit streamlined processes but still struggled with flexibility and scalability when handling iterative software updates and edge cases.

Now, in 2025, QA processes are supercharged by AI-powered tools such as [Zof AI](https://zof.ai). By leveraging machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics, AI platforms are automating testing pipelines, detecting bugs with greater accuracy, and ensuring faster development cycles.
