## Why Testing Methodologies Change in Response to Technology

Testing strategies are constantly shifting to align with emerging technologies, increasing software complexity, and rising user expectations. In the past, QA teams relied on static methods like the waterfall model. The Agile movement then transformed testing into fast-paced, iterative cycles. Now, with advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, the QA process is poised for another leap. 

Key reasons why testing methodologies evolve include:

1. **Increased Software Complexity**: IoT, blockchain, and machine learning applications demand advanced testing that evaluates performance, security, and scalability on a deeper level.
2. **Faster Development Cycles**: The need for speed in delivery requires QA processes to fit into tight timeframes without sacrificing quality.
3. **Technological Advancement**: AI-driven tools such as Zof AI ([Zof AI](https://zof.ai)) provide innovative approaches to predictive analysis, test automation, and system scalability.

By 2025, adaptive frameworks driven by technologies like AI will dominate QA practices, enabling teams to meet modern demands more efficiently. Below, we examine the key methodologies leading this transformation.
