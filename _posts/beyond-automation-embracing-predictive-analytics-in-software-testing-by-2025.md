## Redefining Software Testing: What is Predictive Analytics?

Predictive analytics utilizes artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and statistical models to analyze historical data and forecast software outcomes. Unlike traditional testing which focuses on executing predefined test cases, predictive analytics offers **insight-driven testing** by:

- Identifying potential defects before they occur.
- Prioritizing test cases based on relevance and business impact.
- Highlighting risks using real-time data and past trends.

The result? Reduced surprises, efficient testing cycles, and seamless releases.
