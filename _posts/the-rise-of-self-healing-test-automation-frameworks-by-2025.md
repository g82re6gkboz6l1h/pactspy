## What Is a Self-Healing Test Automation Framework?

Self-healing test frameworks automatically adjust to changes in an application’s structure or behavior, ensuring uninterrupted testing despite frequent UI updates. Powered by AI and machine learning, these tools enhance the resilience of automated tests by detecting changes, updating selectors or attributes, and continuing execution without manual intervention.

Contrast traditional automation that breaks due to minor changes in UI, and it’s clear self-healing frameworks are set to optimize testing processes for modern agile and DevOps workflows.

### Key Features:
- Real-time adaptation to UI changes
- AI-powered object recognition
- Automated application structure updates
