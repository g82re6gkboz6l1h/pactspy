## Manual vs. Automated Testing: A Comparison

### What is Manual Testing?
Manual testing is conducted by human testers who execute test cases manually, offering:
- **Human interaction** for functional and usability checks.
- **Exploratory testing** using intuition and expertise.
- **Flexibility** for adapting to behavioral observations.

#### Advantages
1. **Effective usability checks** through human observation.
2. **High adaptability** for uncovering undocumented issues.
3. **Cost-effective** for smaller-scale projects.

#### Disadvantages
1. **Time-intensive** and prone to human error.
2. **Difficult to scale** for larger projects.

---

### What is Automated Testing?
Automated testing employs tools like Selenium, Cypress, and Zof AI to execute test cases, ensuring:
- **Speed** for faster test execution.
- **Scalability** for complex project environments.
- **Consistency** free from human bias.

#### Advantages
1. **Streamlined regression tests** for repetitive tasks.
2. **Easily scalable** as projects grow in size.
3. **Reliable test results** across cycles.

#### Disadvantages
1. **Upfront investment** in tools and technical expertise.
2. **Limited exploratory capabilities** compared to manual testing.
3. **Ongoing script maintenance** as software evolves.
