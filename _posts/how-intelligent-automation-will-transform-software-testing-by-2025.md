## What is Intelligent Automation in Software Testing?

Intelligent automation combines AI technologies, machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and robotics with software testing workflows. Unlike traditional automation relying on fixed scripts, intelligent automation dynamically adapts, leveraging AI-driven algorithms to improve test accuracy and efficiency.

For instance, while conventional automation suits repetitive tasks, it often falters in volatile testing environments. Intelligent automation thrives by analyzing historical data, adapting scenarios intelligently, and utilizing platforms like Zof AI ([zof.ai](https://zof.ai)). Companies adopting Zof AI report streamlined testing, improved defect detection, and reduced manual input.
