## Key Challenges in Agile Software Testing

Agile teams aim for frequent updates and continuous collaboration. However, these benefits often clash with maintaining rigorous software testing. Agile testing struggles typically involve:

1. **Time-Constrained Sprint Cycles.** Limited timelines (1-4 weeks) make in-depth testing difficult while keeping development pace high.
2. **Complex Integrations.** Systems-dependent software requires intricate testing setups, posing challenges for streamlined workflows.
3. **Communication Silos.** Miscommunication between development, QA, and business teams leads to inefficiencies and errors.
4. **Regression Testing Bottlenecks.** Iterative updates risk breaking existing functionality, making manual regression unfeasible.

These scenarios call for an innovative, Agile-compatible solution. Enter Zof AI.
