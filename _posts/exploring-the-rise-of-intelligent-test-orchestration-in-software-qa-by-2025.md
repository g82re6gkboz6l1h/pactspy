## What is Intelligent Test Orchestration?

*Intelligent test orchestration* utilizes AI-driven methods to automate and optimize QA processes. Unlike traditional test management, it dynamically prioritizes tests, assigns tasks, and adapts to real-time production data, improving decision-making and execution.

Intelligent orchestration addresses the increasing dependencies in microservices, complex integrations, and expansive test suites. By minimizing redundant tests and focusing resources where they matter most, teams can achieve faster releases without sacrificing quality.
