## What is Agile Testing? An Evolution Through Time

Agile testing seamlessly synchronizes with Agile development principles, embedding testing within every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Unlike conventional approaches, Agile testing promotes continuous feedback loops and faster release cycles. It ensures high-quality products tailored to customer needs.

Initially, testers worked in silos, creating a bottleneck. The 2010s saw significant shifts, with testers integrated into Agile teams and the adoption of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). As 2025 looms, automation and AI continue to redefine what software quality assurance (QA) can achieve.
