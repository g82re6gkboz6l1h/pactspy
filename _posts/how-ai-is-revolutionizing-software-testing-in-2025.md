## AI’s Growing Role in Software Testing

AI utilizes machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and pattern recognition to automate test case generation, identify bugs, and predict system failures. Unlike conventional testing, AI adapts and evolves to meet the challenges of increasingly intricate applications. 

This revolutionary technology minimizes human intervention, autonomously identifies potential vulnerabilities, and streamlines QA processes. These changes empower organizations to consistently deliver high-quality software to market faster.
