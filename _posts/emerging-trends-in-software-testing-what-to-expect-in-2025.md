## Top Software Testing Methodologies to Watch

Traditional testing approaches are being replaced by flexible, automated methods to meet modern software demands like cloud computing, microservices, and distributed architectures. Continuous testing stands out as a key practice, embedding testing into every stage of the development lifecycle to ensure early defect detection. Shift-left testing—moving tests earlier into the development phase—will also enable faster, risk-minimized releases. Additional techniques like testing in production and chaos testing will gain prominence, ensuring system resilience under real-world conditions.
