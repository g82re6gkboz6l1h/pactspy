## What Is Regression Testing, and Why Is It Crucial for Modern Development?

### Understanding Regression Testing
**Regression testing** focuses on verifying that recent changes to a software codebase have not disrupted existing functionality. Every update to software—be it bug fixes, new features, or upgrades—comes with the risk of breaking things that previously worked. Regression testing ensures this doesn't happen.

### Key Benefits of Regression Testing
1. **Preserves Core Functionality**: Regression tests safeguard critical features during software updates.
2. **Improves User Experience**: Stability after updates is essential for seamless user experiences.
3. **Empowers Agile Development**: Regular testing supports rapid iterations without compromising quality.

Despite its importance, traditional regression testing faces time, cost, and resource constraints that hinder its efficiency—a gap AI tools like Zof AI are on track to fill.

## Challenges in Current Regression Testing Practices

1. **Time Overheads**: Running comprehensive test suites for every update consumes significant time and delays releases.
2. **Resource Dependency**: Manual interventions and automated testing setups are labor-intensive and prone to human error.
3. **Incomplete Coverage**: Achieving full test coverage for complex systems remains a challenge, leaving vulnerabilities exposed.
4. **High Costs**: Both manual and automated regression testing require heavy investments in resources and maintenance.

AI-driven solutions are emerging as game changers to eliminate these inefficiencies.
