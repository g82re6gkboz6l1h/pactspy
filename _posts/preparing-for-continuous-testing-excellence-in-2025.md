## What is Continuous Testing in Modern DevOps?

Continuous testing integrates automated tests throughout the development lifecycle to guarantee software quality during every stage. Unlike traditional methods, this approach seamlessly aligns testing with DevOps processes by focusing on "shift-left" principles, allowing testing to happen early during development. Key benefits include:

1. **Early Validation**: Identifying bugs early prevents costly production fixes.
2. **Quick Feedback Loops**: Developers receive instant validation for code changes.
3. **Agility in Software Delivery**: Teams adapt rapidly while maintaining reliability.

This methodology reduces risks and speeds up time-to-market. As DevOps practices evolve, continuous testing becomes critical for retaining a competitive edge.
