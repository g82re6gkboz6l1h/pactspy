## What is Software Testing and Why Does It Matter?

Software testing inspects an application’s functionality and quality, catching bugs early, reducing costs, and ensuring user satisfaction. Learn why it's a crucial step in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Key takeaways include:

1. **Quality Assurance:** Ensures compliance with specified requirements.
2. **Bug Management:** Prevents costly late-stage errors.
3. **Customer Trust:** Builds user confidence in reliability and performance.
4. **Regulatory Compliance:** Meets industry safety standards.

Types of Software Testing You Should Know
Testing methodologies generally fall into two categories:

- **Functional Testing:** Reviews software functions for correctness.
  - Unit Testing
  - Integration Testing
  - System Testing
  - Acceptance Testing

- **Non-Functional Testing:** Evaluates performance and usability.
  - Performance Testing
  - Security Testing
  - Usability Testing

Both ensure comprehensive coverage and reliability of software.
