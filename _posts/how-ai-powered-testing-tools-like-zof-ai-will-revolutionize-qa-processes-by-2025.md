## Why AI is Revolutionizing QA
Traditional QA was often manual, limiting scalability and often prone to errors. AI integrates machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), making testing faster, insightful, and scalable.

Benefits include:
- Faster, automated processes.
- Smarter defect detection.
- Real-time data processing.
- Scalable and adaptive workflows.

For teams aiming to ship software faster, tools like Zof AI help reduce error, optimize processes, and enhance results.
