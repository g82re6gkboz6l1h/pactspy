## AI Revolutionizing Software Testing

Historically, software testing relied heavily on manual intervention and static automation scripts. While automation improved speed and consistency, it lacked adaptability to dynamic scenarios. Enter AI, which introduces smarter, autonomous testing powered by machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics.

AI-based tools autonomously generate test cases, analyze failures, and even learn from historical data to improve outcomes, allowing QA professionals to focus on innovation and strategy. With tools such as Zof AI leading the charge, developers can deliver better, faster, and more reliable applications to market.
