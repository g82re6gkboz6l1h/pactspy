## AI and the Evolution of Software Testing

Traditionally, software testing has relied on manual resources and rule-based automation. Manual testing requires human intervention—a resource-heavy and error-prone process—while classic automation struggles with adapting to dynamic and complex software. AI-driven testing is changing this narrative.

Artificial intelligence uses machine learning and natural language processing to adapt to changes, detect defects, generate test cases, and predict future failures. Tools like Zof AI (https://zof.ai) are pioneers in introducing robust QA automation solutions, increasing software quality while reducing development times and operational costs.
