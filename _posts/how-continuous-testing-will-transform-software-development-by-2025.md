## What is Continuous Testing?

Continuous testing embeds testing throughout the software development cycle, ensuring frequent, comprehensive, and automatic testing. Unlike traditional testing methods, this approach shifts left, prioritizing testing early in the design and development phases.

### Why Continuous Testing?
- **Early Issue Detection:** Identify bugs and vulnerabilities before deployment.
- **Automated Efficiency:** Reduce manual testing with automation.
- **Scalability:** Handle complex projects with ease.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Quickly adapt to changes with diagnostic tools.

By integrating AI-powered diagnostics and continuous monitoring, continuous testing ensures faster cycles and uncompromised reliability. With DevOps and Agile practices gaining momentum, experts predict continuous testing will become a cornerstone for top-performing companies by 2025.
