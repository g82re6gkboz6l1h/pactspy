## The Evolution of Software Testing: From Manual to Intelligent

The trajectory of software testing spans decades, evolving from labor-intensive manual processes to streamlined automated solutions. Early testing relied on manual execution, with testers painstakingly finding bugs and validating software functionality. Although automation tools like Selenium and Appium reduced this burden, human involvement remained crucial for analysis and decision-making.

In today's fast-paced software development world, AI steps in as the game-changer. Advanced algorithms, machine learning, and natural language processing empower testers to optimize workflows, reduce human errors, and scale efforts to meet the growing complexity of modern software systems.
