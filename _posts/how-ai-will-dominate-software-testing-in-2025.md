## Why AI is the Future of Software Testing

The software landscape is evolving rapidly, outpacing traditional testing methods that rely on semi-automated workflows and manual practices. These outdated techniques struggle to meet the demands of today’s fast-paced development cycles and stringent quality standards. 

AI provides the solution—bringing unprecedented speed, accuracy, and scalability to software testing. With abilities to analyze complex codebases, identify patterns, and predict defects, AI enables teams to catch bugs early (shifting testing "Left" in the development cycle). By automating tedious tasks, AI optimizes workflows and ensures higher software quality.
