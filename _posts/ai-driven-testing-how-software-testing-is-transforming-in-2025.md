## What is AI-Driven Testing?

AI in software testing leverages machine learning algorithms, predictive analytics, and intelligent automation to enhance Quality Assurance (QA) processes. Traditional testing methods often face limitations in scalability, speed, and consistency, especially for complex systems. By integrating AI, companies can solve these challenges and achieve remarkable outcomes.

Tasks like defect identification, test optimization, and continuous validation are now more efficient and robust. AI systems, such as Zof AI, analyze historical data patterns to predict software vulnerabilities, automate repetitive tasks, and deliver actionable insights.
