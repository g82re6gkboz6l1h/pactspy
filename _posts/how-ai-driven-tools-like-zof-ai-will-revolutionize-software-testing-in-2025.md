## The Journey of Software Testing Evolution

In the early era of software development, manual testing dominated the scene. Quality Assurance (QA) engineers meticulously followed checklists to catch bugs and ensure software functionality. While effective for simpler projects, this process became increasingly unsustainable as software complexity grew.

The introduction of test automation brought the first paradigm shift. Tools like Selenium and JUnit eliminated repetitive manual tasks, speeding up the process. Yet, these tools operated on rigid scripts, requiring human intervention for updates and lacking adaptability for dynamic scenarios.

Now, the modern software ecosystem includes cloud-based applications, APIs, and high-scale user interactions, demanding testing solutions that are scalable, efficient, and intelligent. AI emerges as the answer to these challenges.
