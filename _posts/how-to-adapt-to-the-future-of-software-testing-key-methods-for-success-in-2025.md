## Exploring the Evolution of Software Testing

Software testing has progressed from manual methods to automated, AI-powered practices that deliver efficient and scalable solutions. Key milestones include:

1. **Manual Testing**: Testing processes were initially manual, involving step-by-step troubleshooting by human testers.
2. **Test Automation**: The early 2000s saw tools like Selenium enabling automation, enhancing testing speeds and efficiency.
3. **Shift Left Testing**: QA integration earlier in development cycles became essential to prevent late-stage issues.
4. **AI-Driven Testing**: Today’s AI tools enable predictive analytics, self-healing scripts, and faster testing across complex architectures.

Robust QA practices are pivotal to meeting user expectations for seamless performance and security. Adapting to these advancements is no longer optional—it's vital for future success.
