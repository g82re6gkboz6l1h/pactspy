## The Evolution of Software Testing Technologies

Over the past decade, software testing has undergone remarkable advancements. From transitioning away from manual regression testing to adopting automation tools like Selenium and Cypress, the focus has shifted toward speed, efficiency, and scalability. Test automation frameworks have empowered teams, especially in agile and DevOps environments, to integrate testing early (shift-left) and expand into runtime observability (shift-right) using tools in continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. 

Cloud-based testing and containerization platforms have risen in utilization, enabling scalable testing. These changes, however, are only a glimpse of the trajectory software testing will take by 2025.
