## Evolution of Software Testing Over the Years

What started as a manual, labor-intensive process has steadily evolved into a highly automated, efficient system. Early testing efforts relied on scripts and rigorous manual quality checks but often suffered from human error and sluggish timelines.

The emergence of Agile and DevOps methodologies brought monumental changes, focusing on integrating testing early in the development cycle. Automation then gained prominence with tools like Selenium and JUnit enabling expansive regression testing and faster iterations. Fast forward to 2025, and software testing isn't just about verifying features—it’s about embedding quality across end-to-end workflows with innovative technologies.
