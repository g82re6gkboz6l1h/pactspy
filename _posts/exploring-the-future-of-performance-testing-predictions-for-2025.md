## What is Performance Testing and Why is it Important?

Performance testing determines how well a system handles factors like speed, stability, and scalability under specific workloads. While functional testing ensures that software performs its intended tasks, performance testing focuses on its behavior under stress. Slow websites, crashes, or unresponsive apps can mean significant losses for companies in revenue and consumer trust.

As user expectations for speed and reliability mount, performance testing has become a vital step in the software development lifecycle. By 2025, growing technological demands and higher traffic will push businesses to adopt more advanced performance testing tools and strategies.
