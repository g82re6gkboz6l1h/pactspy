## The Persistent Challenges of Traditional Test Automation

Test automation has been a cornerstone of modern QA strategies, helping teams validate software functionality, performance, and reliability. However, traditional approaches still come with notable limitations:

### 1. **High Maintenance Burdens**
Test scripts often demand constant updates when applications evolve, draining resources and slowing down productivity.

### 2. **Poor Adaptability**
In dynamic and agile environments, traditional test tools fail to seamlessly respond to frequent changes without significant manual intervention.

### 3. **Limited Test Coverage**
Expanding test coverage to accommodate multi-platform, multi-device, and multi-browser compatibility remains a challenge.

### 4. **Skilled Resource Dependency**
Conventional automation tools often require technical expertise, posing challenges for smaller teams and organizations with fewer resources.

These challenges have heightened the demand for smarter and scalable solutions in QA—paving the way for AI tools to redefine test automation.
