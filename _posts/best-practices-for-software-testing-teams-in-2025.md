## Foundational Principles for Testing in 2025

No matter how technology advances, foundational principles remain key to achieving software quality and ensuring efficient testing processes.

### Shift-Left Testing
Integrating testing into the earlier stages of the development lifecycle is critical. By testing during the requirement analysis phase, costs associated with fixing bugs are reduced, and teams can maintain faster release schedules. Collaboration between developers and testers at the conceptual stage provides stronger quality control.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
These methodologies ensure higher code quality and alignment with business requirements. Following TDD and BDD will remain essential in 2025.

### Security First
With increasing cybersecurity threats, testing teams must incorporate penetration testing, vulnerability scans, and ethical hacking simulations as a core part of their strategy.

### Ethical AI Validation
As AI technologies grow, testing frameworks must rigorously assess AI models for accuracy, bias, and alignment with ethical regulations.
