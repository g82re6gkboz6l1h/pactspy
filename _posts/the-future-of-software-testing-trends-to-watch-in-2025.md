## Evolving Testing Methodologies in 2025: Agile, DevOps, and Continuous Testing

Modern software testing strategies are increasingly critical components of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Agile and DevOps practices will dominate in 2025, with testing fully integrated during various development phases. Continuous testing methodologies, replacing outdated waterfall approaches, are set to minimize defect detection timelines, boost collaboration, and accelerate delivery cycles.

Advancements in tools and platforms utilizing AI and machine learning (ML) will support this shift, offering efficiency in defect detection, faster execution, and improved decision-making. Accessible testing tools will further enhance collaboration while democratizing workflows, ensuring QA becomes a seamless aspect of the development process.
