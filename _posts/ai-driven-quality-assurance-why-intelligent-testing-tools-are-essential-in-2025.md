## The Evolution of AI in Software Testing

Artificial intelligence integration into QA marks a paradigm shift. Manual testing not only consumed time but introduced errors, while early automation tools like Selenium required significant human intervention. AI bridges these limitations by utilizing machine learning (ML), neural networks, and predictive analytics to autonomously learn application behavior, identify bugs, and predict failures. 

Smart tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) exemplify this shift with intelligent exploratory testing, autonomous script generation, and unmatched test accuracy. They are rapidly becoming indispensable in Agile and DevOps workflows.
