## The Evolution of AI in Software Testing

Traditional software testing relied heavily on manual processes requiring human testers to design and execute test cases, often causing delays due to human error and inefficiencies. AI has revolutionized this landscape through automation and intelligent analysis.

Early AI testing tools addressed fundamental issues like bug detection and regression testing. Today, AI incorporates advanced technologies such as Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Deep Learning to predict defects, simulate user behavior, and scale testing environments. The ability to analyze patterns in large datasets and anticipate software flaws has made AI indispensable in QA practices.
