## Revolutionizing QA: The Role of AI in 2025

Over the past decade, the complexities of software systems — from websites to IoT (Internet of Things) devices — have rendered traditional QA methods inadequate. Manual testing remains labor-intensive and prone to human error, while traditional automation struggles to adapt to modern requirements.

AI bridges the gap by leveraging big data and predictive algorithms to enhance QA workflows. By 2025, most QA teams depend on AI-driven platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) to identify errors, forecast potential bugs, and streamline software testing in alignment with DevOps and CI/CD pipelines. Rather than being reactive, testing processes are now proactive and predictive.
