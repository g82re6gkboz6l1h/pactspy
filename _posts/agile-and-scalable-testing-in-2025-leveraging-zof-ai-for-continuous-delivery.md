## Why Scalable Testing is Critical in Agile

Agile development promotes rapid iterations and frequent releases, leaving traditional testing strategies struggling to keep up. Scalable testing ensures you maintain efficiency even as applications grow in complexity.

### Key Benefits of Scalable Testing:
1. **Speed and Adaptability**: Quickly identify and address code changes without compromising quality.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Minimize costs with tools like Zof AI, reducing redundancies and maximizing automation.
3. **Continuous Workflows**: Prevent delays with seamless test integration in agile cycles.

To thrive in 2025, agile teams must adopt scalable testing that aligns with evolving software, supports continuous delivery goals, and improves developer productivity.
