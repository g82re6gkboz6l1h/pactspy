## What is Continuous Testing?

Continuous Testing involves executing automated tests throughout the development lifecycle, offering rapid feedback on risks and software quality. Unlike traditional testing, it integrates testing into every development phase to identify defects early and accelerate releases.

### Key Benefits of Continuous Testing
1. **Early Risk Detection**: Catch and fix issues during early development stages.
2. **Collaborative Development**: Enhances communication among development, QA, and IT teams.
3. **Speed and Efficiency**: Automates repetitive testing processes, enabling faster delivery cycles.
4. **Cost Savings**: Mitigates costly post-release bug fixes by detecting issues earlier.
