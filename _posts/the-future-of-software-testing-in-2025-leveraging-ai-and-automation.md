## The Evolution of Software Testing

Software testing is fundamental for delivering high-quality applications. It has undergone three major phases:

1. **Manual Testing Era**: Relied on human effort, with test cases created and executed manually—a method that was labor-intensive and inefficient.
2. **Rise of Automated Testing**: Tools like Selenium and Appium automated repetitive tasks, accelerating testing to align with agile development.
3. **Intelligent Testing Revolution**: AI and machine learning now enable predictive, automated QA processes—shifting focus to improvement over bug-fixing.

The future heralds intelligent, data-driven testing for seamless, high-performance applications.
