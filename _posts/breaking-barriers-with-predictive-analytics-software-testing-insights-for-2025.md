## What is Predictive Analytics in Software Testing?  
Predictive analytics leverages historical data, machine learning (ML), and statistical algorithms to forecast potential outcomes. For software testing, this means predicting bugs, prioritizing functionalities needing rigorous testing, and addressing issues before they arise in production.

### Key Predictive Analytics Features for Testing:  
1. **Defect Prediction**: Identifies sections likely to have bugs.
2. **Risk Assessment**: Pinpoints high-risk areas to focus efforts.
3. **Effort Estimation**: Optimizes resource allocation by predicting testing demands.
4. **Test Optimization**: Ensures no redundant test cases bog down processes.

This proactive approach empowers teams to deliver consistent, high-quality software while saving time and costs.
