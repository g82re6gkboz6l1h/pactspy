## Machine Learning Simplifies QA Processes

Machine Learning (ML) is reshaping testing methodologies. Unlike static traditional approaches, ML’s ability to adapt and self-optimize enables smarter, faster results. Here's how ML is simplifying QA:

### Key Features:
1. **Dynamic Test Creation**: Zof AI utilizes ML to automate test case creation based on real-world data, saving time and resources.
2. **Accurate Defect Predictions**: ML analyzes code patterns to identify vulnerable areas, allowing Zof AI to predict defects before they happen.
3. **Streamlined Test Execution**: Intelligent prioritizations by Zof AI cut wasted time by focusing on critical areas.
4. **Self-Healing Tests**: With Zof AI, failed tests automatically self-repair after code or UI updates, lowering maintenance needs dramatically.

By reducing redundancy and enabling smarter workflows, ML tools give teams more bandwidth to focus on innovation rather than repetitive processes.
