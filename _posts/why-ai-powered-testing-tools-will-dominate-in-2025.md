## Challenges with Manual and Automated Testing

Manual testing, though thorough, struggles with:

- **Time Consumption**: Manually executing test cases and scripting automated ones are labor-intensive.
- **Human Error**: Mistakes and overlooked edge cases are inevitable.
- **Scalability Issues**: Traditional methods lack the flexibility needed for large, agile workflows.
- **Static Scripts**: Automation tools often require frequent updates, adding complexity.
- **Higher Costs**: Resource-heavy manual efforts drain budgets.

Traditional methods aren’t meeting the demands of dynamic software environments. This shortfall is paving the way for AI-driven innovation.
