## What is Hyperautomation in QA?

Hyperautomation leverages AI, ML, and RPA to automate every aspect of QA workflows, including test case creation, execution, and reporting. Unlike traditional automation frameworks, hyperautomation integrates adaptive intelligence, enabling self-learning testing systems that reduce manual involvement while enhancing testing accuracy and efficiency.

### Features of Hyperautomation in QA:
- **Automated Test Case Generation:** Uses AI to create test cases directly from application requirements.
- **Predictive Defect Analysis:** Applies ML algorithms to detect high-risk areas likely to contain defects.
- **Self-Healing Test Suites:** Updates test cases automatically in response to application changes.
- **Actionable Reporting:** Provides data-driven insights into test efficacy, defect trends, and QA performance.
