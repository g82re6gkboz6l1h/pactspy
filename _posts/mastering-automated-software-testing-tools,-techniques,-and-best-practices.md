## Introduction to Automated Software Testing

Automated testing uses specialized tools to execute software tests, validate outcomes, and locate bugs without manual intervention. It offers several key advantages:

1. **Efficiency**: Reduces the time spent on repeatable regression tests.
2. **Accuracy**: Eliminates human error to provide consistent results.
3. **Cost-effectiveness**: Early bug detection lowers overall development costs.
4. **Scalability**: Executes complex test scenarios that manual testing would struggle to handle.

With these benefits, automated testing is integral to agile and DevOps environments, enabling faster delivery cycles and superior product quality.
