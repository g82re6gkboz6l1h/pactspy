## How AI is Transforming QA in Software Testing

Quality Assurance stands at the heart of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Historically dependent on manual processes and static automated scripts, the growing complexity of software systems has revealed the inefficiencies of traditional QA methods. Enter AI-powered testing — an advanced solution capable of processing vast datasets, identifying issues faster, and offering actionable insights at a scale unreachable by manual efforts.

AI’s machine learning capabilities empower it to learn continuously, predicting issues before they surface and tailoring solutions dynamically. AI tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) leverage natural language processing (NLP) and ML to generate test cases, detect anomalies, and self-heal scripts after code changes, minimizing human intervention.
