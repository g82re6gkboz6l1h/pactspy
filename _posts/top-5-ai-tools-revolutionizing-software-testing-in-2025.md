## Overview of AI Technology in Software Testing

Traditional software testing has been a labor-intensive process requiring QA engineers to manually inspect lines of code and execute repetitive test cases. While test automation tools helped reduce redundancy, they still demanded significant human intervention for scripting and maintenance.

AI has revolutionized this process, offering solutions that:

1. Generate and maintain test cases intelligently.
2. Predict failures before they occur.
3. Deliver real-time test results.
4. Reduce repetitive work for QA teams.
5. Simulate human-like behavior for better UI/UX testing.

Businesses striving for more efficient CI/CD pipelines and higher-quality software now embrace AI technology as an essential component. Leading this innovation, **Zof AI** is changing how organizations approach software testing.
