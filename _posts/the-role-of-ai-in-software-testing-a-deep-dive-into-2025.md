## Why AI is Transforming QA Practices in Software Testing

### Speed and Automation
AI eliminates redundant tasks such as script creation and debugging, ensuring unprecedented efficiency. By generating intelligent test cases and detecting anomalies automatically, QA practitioners focus on strategy rather than repetitive chores.

### Faster Time-to-Market
AI-driven tools adapt to Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes, reducing delivery cycles while maintaining high accuracy with features like defect clustering and test prioritization.

### Scalability
From managing global systems featuring billions of code lines to adapting during application updates, AI scales testing like never before, ensuring comprehensive quality assurance quickly.
