## Traditional QA: Challenges in a Rapid Development World

For decades, QA has relied heavily on manual and semi-automated testing approaches. While these methods had their place, today’s complex and speedy development cycles expose several inefficiencies in the traditional framework:

1. **Time-Intensive Processes:** Manual testing can be slow, especially under tight development schedules.
2. **Resource Heavy:** Skilled human testers are required to execute repetitive, error-prone tasks.
3. **Scalability Issues:** Larger, more complicated projects strain traditional QA capabilities.
4. **Lag in Agile Workflows:** Manual processes hinder swift iterations necessary in Agile or DevOps environments.
5. **Reactive, Not Proactive:** Manual QA catches bugs but rarely predicts or preempts them.

As developers demand quicker tools and reliable systems, AI solutions like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai?src=pactspy.vercel.app) emerge as game-changers in addressing these limitations.
