## What Are Self-Adaptive Test Suites, and How Do They Work?

Self-adaptive test suites are dynamic systems that revolutionize QA by addressing inefficiencies in traditional static testing. These intelligent suites modify themselves in real-time, adapting to changes in the codebase and environment.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Evolution:** Uses AI to add, modify, or remove tests based on code updates.
- **Prioritized Testing:** Focuses on critical vulnerabilities and risk zones.
- **Flexibility:** Adapts to environmental or dependency changes.

By continuously learning from historical data and real-time feedback, these systems eliminate manual tuning while improving the accuracy and efficiency of testing, ensuring software quality at scale.
