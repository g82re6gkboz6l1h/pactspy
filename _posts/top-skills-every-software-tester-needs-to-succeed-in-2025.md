## Must-Have Skills for Modern QA Professionals

### 1. **Testing Fundamentals**
Traditional QA knowledge—test design, regression testing, defect tracking—remains essential, especially in exploratory testing where human intuition excels.

### 2. **Cross-Functional Knowledge**
Expand your expertise into programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript), database systems, and UX principles for seamless team collaboration.

### 3. **Strategic Test Planning**
Rapid timelines require robust test plans prioritizing critical functionalities through risk-based testing.

### 4. **DevOps Proficiency**
In CI/CD workflows, testers need automation tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD to provide rapid, actionable test feedback.
