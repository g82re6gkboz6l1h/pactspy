## Unpacking AI in Software Testing

AI in software testing uses intelligent algorithms and machine learning to automate and enhance the testing process. AI mimics human decision-making to detect anomalies, predict failures, and adapt to codebase updates in real-time. By leveraging historic datasets, AI tools perform test case generation, defect identification, and risk reduction with zero or minimal human input. This evolution redefines software testing between 2023 and 2025, achieving higher precision and faster results.

### Gains over Traditional Methods 
Traditional testing struggles to keep pace with rapid deployments. AI testing transforms these limitations by:
- Reducing manual effort.
- Automatically adapting to application changes.
- Offering predictive bug identification and failure risk management.
- Speeding up iterations in agile environments.

By embedding AI capabilities in QA workflows, teams can boost speed, reduce errors, and meet increasing market demands effortlessly.
