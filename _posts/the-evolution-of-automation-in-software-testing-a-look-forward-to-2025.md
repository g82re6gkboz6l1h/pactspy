## The Automation Journey: From Manual to Intelligent Testing

Software testing has undergone a seismic shift over the decades. Early methods relied heavily on manual testing, which, while thorough, lacked scalability and efficiency for large-scale systems. The early 2000s ushered in automation tools such as Selenium, leading to faster regression testing. Soon, robust frameworks like Appium, JUnit, and TestNG emerged, extending automation's reach into functional, performance, and security tests.

Despite their transformative capabilities, these tools required substantial scripting expertise and struggled with the dynamic complexity of modern software systems. Automation needed to evolve—and it did—with AI-driven innovations like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai).
