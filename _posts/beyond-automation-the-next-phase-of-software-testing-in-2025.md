## Limitations of Traditional Automated Testing

Traditional automated testing relies heavily on scripted inputs, leading to scalability and adaptation challenges. Maintaining test scripts becomes time-consuming when applications change. Additionally, traditional tools lack intelligent capabilities for prioritizing critical tests, often falling short in modern software architectures like microservices and APIs. Hyper-automation emerges to streamline and intelligently direct workflows through AI-driven insights.
