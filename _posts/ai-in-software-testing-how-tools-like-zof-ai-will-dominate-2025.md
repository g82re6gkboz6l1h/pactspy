## The Role of AI in Redefining Software Testing

Conventional testing relied on manual processes or basic automation, both unable to keep up with modern applications' complexities. Today, AI systems excel by:

- **Analyzing massive datasets** with precision.
- **Adapting to dynamic environments** through machine learning and pattern recognition.
- **Proactively identifying and preventing defects** during development.

Platforms like Zof AI exemplify how AI enhances testing, automating tasks while achieving deeper precision and scalability.
