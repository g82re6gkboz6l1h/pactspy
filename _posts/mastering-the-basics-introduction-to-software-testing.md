## What is Software Testing?
Software testing identifies errors, gaps, or unmet requirements, ensuring software performs as expected under various scenarios. This quality assurance process can be manual or automated and provides answers to critical questions like:
- Does the software function as intended?
- Is the user experience seamless?
- Are there any performance or security vulnerabilities?

Without rigorous testing, projects risk flawed outputs, compromising user trust and market success.
