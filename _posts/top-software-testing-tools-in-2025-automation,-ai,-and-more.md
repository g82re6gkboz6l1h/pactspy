**Manual vs. Automated Testing: A 2025 Perspective**

### **Comparison Table**
| Aspect           | Manual Testing                                   | Automated Testing                                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Speed            | Deliberate human input required.                | Rapid, continuous execution without intervention.|
| Accuracy         | Subject to human error.                         | Precise; operates exactly as programmed.         |
| Initial Setup    | Quick and inexpensive.                          | Time-intensive setup with higher upfront cost.   |
| Cost             | Scales poorly, increasing costs over time.      | Cost-efficient for repetitive or large projects. |
| Suitability      | Best for exploratory and usability tests.       | Ideal for regression and performance testing.    |
| Evolution        | Manual adaptation to updates.                   | AI adapts dynamically, e.g., Zof AI’s features.  |
