## Software Testing Evolution: From Manual to AI-Driven

Over the years, software testing has evolved from labor-intensive manual processes to automated and intelligent ecosystems. Traditional methods, like manual testing in waterfall models, often resulted in delays, as bugs were identified later in the development cycle. However, the introduction of Agile and DevOps principles marked a significant shift, integrating testing earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). 

Looking ahead to 2025, cutting-edge technologies like AI and machine learning are transforming software testing. Rather than merely detecting bugs, the focus is on creating a seamless, automated process employing predictive analytics and AI-driven tools. Future software testing strategies will aim to ensure quality in increasingly complex systems while significantly improving efficiency and scalability.
