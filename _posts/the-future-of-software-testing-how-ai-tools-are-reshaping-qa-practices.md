## Introduction to AI in Software Testing

Traditional approaches to software testing have relied heavily on manual processes, exhaustive scripting, and human intervention—methods that often lack efficiency and scalability. The arrival of AI in software testing introduces smarter solutions, automating repetitive tasks while uncovering hidden patterns in vast amounts of data.

AI testing tools harness advanced techniques such as machine learning (ML), predictive modeling, and natural language processing to optimize the testing lifecycle. They reduce human effort while enhancing accuracy, making testing workflows faster and more cost-effective. By integrating AI, QA teams can achieve exceptional test coverage, prioritize areas most susceptible to errors, and create test scenarios dynamically.
