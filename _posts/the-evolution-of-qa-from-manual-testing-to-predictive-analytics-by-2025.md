## Manual Testing to Predictive Analytics: A Landmark Transition

Manual testing, while thorough, was labor-intensive and error-prone. Automation tools like Selenium and JUnit dramatically improved processes but lacked predictive foresight. Predictive analytics changes the game — it analyzes historical data and user behavior to flag vulnerabilities before development begins. By 2025, predictive QA systems will revolutionize software testing by anticipating risks, reducing redundancies, and enhancing resilience.
