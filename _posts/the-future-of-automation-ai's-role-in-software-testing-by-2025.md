Predictive Analytics: AI's Key Contribution to QA

Predictive analytics marks a breakthrough in quality assurance, shifting from reactive to proactive testing. Traditional methods wait to detect bugs post-development, but AI tools identify issues earlier. Predictive workflows use:

1. **Data Aggregation**: AI analyzes past testing and production data to highlight risk zones.
2. **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Focuses testing on critical components based on vulnerability likelihood.
3. **Continuous Feedback**: Adaptive models improve predictions with ongoing data.

By 2025, predictive analytics-driven workflows will empower companies to deliver faster, more reliable, and cost-effective software solutions.
