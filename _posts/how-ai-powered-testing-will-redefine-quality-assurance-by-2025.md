## The Game-Changing Role of AI in Testing Evolution

The adoption of AI in software testing has been a gradual process that started with automation. In the early 2010s, automated testing gained traction for its ability to handle repetitive tasks, but it stopped short of incorporating adaptability and decision-making—a gap AI aims to fill.

Today's AI tools leverage machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to enhance traditional testing techniques. These tools learn from data, predict risks, and adapt test processes dynamically. By 2025, AI will move from a supporting role to becoming the central pillar of QA strategies, driving rapid innovation across industries.
