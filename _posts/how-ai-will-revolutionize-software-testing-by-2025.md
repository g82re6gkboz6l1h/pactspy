## Key Challenges in Traditional Software Testing

### 1. **Manual Testing Limitations**
Manual quality assurance is intensive, prone to human error, and hard to scale in agile environments.

### 2. **Complex Software Ecosystems**
Modern systems involve APIs, microservices, and multi-device setups, requiring advanced expertise and longer testing durations.

### 3. **Scalability Problems**
Traditional testing tools struggle to scale as applications grow more intricate and test scenarios multiply.

### 4. **Lack of Predictive Capabilities**
Predicting vulnerabilities and prioritizing testing efforts systematically remains a challenge for traditional methods.

### 5. **CI/CD Bottlenecks**
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines demand faster cycles, but traditional testing often leads to delays.
