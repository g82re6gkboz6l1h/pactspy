## Hyperautomation: Redefining Testing Strategies
Hyperautomation in testing extends automation beyond basic test execution. By utilizing AI, machine learning (ML), robotic process automation (RPA), and data analytics, it streamlines manual workflows and resolves inefficiencies in dynamic software environments.

### Key Features of Hyperautomation in QA:
- **AI-Powered Test Creation**: Streamlines workflows by autonomously generating test cases.
- **Self-Healing Scripts**: Corrects failed scripts to ensure uninterrupted automation.
- **Predictive Defect Analysis**: Forecasts software vulnerabilities using ML algorithms.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Tracks test performance to identify inefficiencies without relying on manual input.

Hyperautomation augments human testers, enabling them to focus on strategy, exploratory test creation, and dynamic problem-solving.
