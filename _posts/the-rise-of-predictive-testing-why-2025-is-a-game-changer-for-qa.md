## What is Predictive Testing?
Predictive testing is an advanced method that leverages machine learning (ML) and big data analytics to pinpoint potential software defects in the development cycle. Unlike traditional reactive QA approaches, this methodology analyzes historical data, user behavior, log trends, and performance metrics to identify high-risk areas in the codebase.

### Key Features of Predictive Testing:
1. **Defect Clustering:** Locates code sections prone to errors using past development data.
2. **Performance Projections:** Forecasts system performance bottlenecks before deployment.
3. **Risk Assessment:** Maps vulnerabilities and prioritizes testing efforts based on risk scores.

Predictive testing empowers teams to save time, reduce debugging costs, and optimize development efficiency—all hallmarks of software success.
