## What is Continuous Testing and Why It Matters?

Continuous testing involves executing automated tests throughout the software development lifecycle. Unlike manual testing approaches of the past, continuous testing integrates tests early and continuously to minimize defects and optimize software quality. 

### Importance of Continuous Testing:

- **Faster Time-to-Market:** Competing in the fast-paced 2025 landscape demands quick deployment cycles without jeopardizing quality.
- **Enhanced Security:** Proactive testing reduces last-minute vulnerabilities and strengthens software security systems.
- **Improved Team Collaboration:** Real-time testing supports transparency across development, QA, and operations teams.
