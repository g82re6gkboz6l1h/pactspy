## 1. Transitioning to Modern Testing Methodologies

The days of traditional manual testing are long gone. Advanced methodologies like Agile, DevOps, and DevSecOps pave the future of testing as they integrate seamlessly into the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

### Key Highlights:
- **Shift Left Testing**: Catch issues earlier in the SDLC.
- **Testing as Code**: Automate test scripts and manage them as software code.
- **AI-Driven Testing**: Predict failures, enhance coverage, and elevate efficiency using AI.

Adopt a proactive approach, embracing the latest tools and frameworks to stay competitive as a tester or developer.
