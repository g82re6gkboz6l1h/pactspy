## The New Era: AI in Quality Assurance

Quality Assurance has historically relied on manual efforts and rudimentary tools to identify defects and align with user expectations. These processes often lead to delays and errors. AI is the antidote to these inefficiencies.

Powered by machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision, AI introduces advanced systems capable of predicting, analyzing, and automating. The outcome? Fewer errors, streamlined workflows, and unprecedented QA output.

### Zof AI: Innovation at Your Fingertips
