## Understanding Agile Testing in Software Development

Agile testing is continuous, involving testers seamlessly throughout the development cycle. This approach contrasts sharply with traditional, isolated testing phases.

### Key Features of Agile Testing:
1. **Incremental Testing:** Features tested iteratively.
2. **Collaboration:** QA, developers, and clients work together.
3. **Flexibility:** Adaptable strategies for changing project scopes.
4. **Early Defect Detection:** Reduces costly fixes by starting testing early.
5. **Automation Focus:** Relies on tools for faster feedback loops.

Embed testing within the agile framework for accelerated outputs without sacrificing quality.
