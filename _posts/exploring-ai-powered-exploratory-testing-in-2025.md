## What is Exploratory Testing and Why is it Important?

Exploratory testing is an interactive and flexible software testing process where testers examine a system to uncover bugs, enhance usability, and predict vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional scripted testing, exploratory testing depends on human creativity and adaptability, allowing QA experts to test applications systematically and intuitively.

As agile and DevOps workflows grow, exploratory testing is crucial for:

1. Identifying UX/UI issues undetectable by automated scripts.
2. Quickly adjusting to dynamic requirements.
3. Gaining better insights into application functionality and failure scenarios.

Historically, exploratory testing has been manual and time-intensive, but AI now enables faster, more consistent processes, making it indispensable in 2025’s fast-paced development landscape.
