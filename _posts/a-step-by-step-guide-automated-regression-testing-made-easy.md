## Why Regression Testing Is Essential

Software development constantly evolves, with applications undergoing modifications to incorporate new features and fix bugs. Unfortunately, these changes can inadvertently introduce defects or disrupt functionalities. Regression testing ensures stability by validating software performance after updates.

### Advantages of Regression Testing:
1. **Guarantees Software Stability**: Verifies functionality remains intact post-updates.
2. **Prevents Old Defects**: Catches bugs that might resurface due to newly implemented changes.
3. **Enhances User Satisfaction**: Ensures consistent quality that improves user adoption.
4. **Reduces Expenses**: Early defect detection lowers repair costs during production.

However, manually performing regression tests can be labor-intensive. Automation steps in to optimize the process significantly.
