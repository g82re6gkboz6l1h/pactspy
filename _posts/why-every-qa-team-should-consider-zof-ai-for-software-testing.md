## Key Challenges that QA Teams Face

### 1. **Inefficient Manual Testing**
Manual testing can be exhaustive and slow, especially as release deadlines shrink. Many QA teams find themselves racing against time, leading to errors and limited productivity.

### 2. **Human Errors Compromising Accuracy**
No matter how experienced, human-driven testing is prone to overlook defects. This can result in product issues post-launch, harming brand credibility.

### 3. **Inconsistent Coverage**
QA teams often miss gaps during testing due to limited resources, leaving critical parts of the application vulnerable.

### 4. **Difficulty Scaling Processes**
Testing demands increase as applications grow more complex, but it’s challenging to scale QA without higher costs or additional resources.

### 5. **Resource Constraints**
Limited budgets force QA teams to prioritize testing selectively, leaving areas of the application untested, increasing risks for errors.

For QA teams, these issues incur higher costs, delays, and disappointed users. Zof AI counters these problems with groundbreaking AI-powered automation.
