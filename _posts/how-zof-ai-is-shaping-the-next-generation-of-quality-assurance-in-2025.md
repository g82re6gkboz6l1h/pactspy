## Challenges in Traditional QA Methods

Traditional QA practices rely heavily on manual testing or scripted approaches. Though functional, these methods are often plagued by inefficiencies:

1. **Lengthy Testing Cycles**: Manual testing prolongs product release timelines due to labor-intensive efforts in regression and performance testing.
2. **Scaling Limitations**: Traditional methods struggle to accommodate growing test scenarios without significant resource increases.
3. **Inadequate Coverage**: Manual testing often overlooks edge cases in complex, data-heavy, or distributed applications.
4. **High Costs**: Maintaining large QA teams or environments inflates operational budgets, leading to compromises on quality.

Such challenges necessitate innovative solutions, and Zof AI provides the answers.
