## What is Regression Testing?

### Definition of Regression Testing
Regression testing verifies software updates don’t negatively impact existing functionalities. When implementing code changes, developers risk unforeseen errors jeopardizing the software’s integrity. Regression testing mitigates these risks early, ensuring optimal functionality is preserved.

### Why is Regression Testing Crucial?
Continuous software updates are essential for progress, yet they increase risks:

- **Customer dissatisfaction:** Bugs can hinder user experience, damaging trust.
- **Higher costs:** Fixing issues post-deployment is costly compared to early detection.
- **Security risks:** Unnoticed vulnerabilities can lead to major breaches.

Regression testing safeguards software functionality amid ongoing updates.
