## The Pitfalls of Traditional QA

Manual testing struggles to handle the demands of rapid software innovation. Common challenges include:

- **Heavy Resource Requirements**: QA engineers dedicate excessive time and labor to test systems manually.
- **Coverage Limitations**: Traditional methods fail to explore comprehensive workflows, especially edge cases.
- **Delayed Feedback Cycles**: Identifying bugs late in development slows production schedules.
- **Human Error Risks**: Fatigue causes inaccuracies that compromise accuracy.
- **Scaling Constraints**: Expanding QA workflows to match application growth presents obstacles.

These issues highlight the need for AI-driven transformation, steering the QA industry into a new paradigm.
