## Key Challenges in QA Testing Today

Modern QA involves a variety of interconnected applications, APIs, cloud environments, and IoT devices. Here's what’s holding teams back:

- **Scalability Issues**: Managing thousands of simultaneous processes makes it hard for manual and traditional tools to ensure reliability.
- **Speed Constraints**: Tight delivery timelines from CI/CD pipelines increase pressure on QA teams.
- **Human Error**: Repetitive testing tasks can lead to fatigue and undetected bugs.
- **Lack of Contextual Insight**: Identifying not only bugs but their broader implications is still a challenge.
- **Increasing Complexity**: Testing technologies like AI algorithms, blockchain, or microservices is beyond the scope of legacy tools.
