## Introduction: Autonomous Testing Paradigm

The pressure on QA teams to deliver rapid and continuous testing in Agile and DevOps environments has highlighted the inefficiencies of manual testing processes. While traditional automation improves speed, it still relies on human oversight for script creation and maintenance. Autonomous testing paradigms completely remove human intervention by leveraging AI to analyze application behavior, identify edge cases, and optimize workflows dynamically. Companies like **Zof AI** are leading this innovation, setting a benchmark for fully autonomous QA frameworks.
