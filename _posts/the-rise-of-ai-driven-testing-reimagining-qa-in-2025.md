## What is AI-Driven Testing?

The software testing industry has evolved from manual methods to automation and now to a revolutionary phase—AI-driven testing. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, this advanced approach enhances software quality assurance (QA) by automating and optimizing processes while predicting and preventing errors.

AI-driven testing is not merely about automated test cases; it incorporates intelligent analytics, predictive modeling, and adaptability. Cutting-edge platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) showcase how artificial intelligence can streamline QA workflows, preemptively identify bugs, recommend fixes, and adapt in real-time to software modifications. With these advancements, AI-driven testing is set to become integral to software development by 2025.
