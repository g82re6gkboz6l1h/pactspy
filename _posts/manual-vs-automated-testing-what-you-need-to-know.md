## Manual vs Automated Testing: A Detailed Comparison

### Manual Testing: Leveraging Human Intuition
Manual testing involves testers interacting directly with applications to identify bugs and validate functionality.

#### Characteristics:
- **Human-Driven:** Personalized assessments uncover nuanced usability issues.
- **Flexible:** Adaptable for exploratory or unstructured testing.
- **Time-Intensive:** Requires incremental execution.

### Automated Testing: Harnessing Technology
Automated testing uses tools and scripts to run test cases efficiently.

#### Characteristics:
- **Speed:** Ideal for repetitive tests like regression or performance.
- **Scalable:** Suitable for large, complex projects.
- **Accurate:** Reduces human error reliance.
