## Introduction to AI in Software Testing

AI is a game-changer for industries across the board, including software testing. Leveraging machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, AI simulates human intelligence to automate complex tasks efficiently.

Unlike traditional test automation reliant on predefined test scripts, AI-enhanced tools dynamically learn from past behaviors, detect patterns, and optimize the testing process, making it smarter and more adaptive. This results in reduced manual dependency, improved scalability, and higher software reliability.
