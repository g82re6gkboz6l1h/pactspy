## Proven Testing Strategies for Agile Teams

Agile workflows call for tailored approaches to ensure software quality:

### 1. **Shift-Left Testing**
   - Test early in the development lifecycle to identify bugs before they escalate. Benefits include reduced costs and faster feedback loops.

### 2. **Automated Testing**
   - Automate regression, performance, and functional tests to save time and improve accuracy. Tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) streamline these processes.

### 3. **Continuous Testing in CI/CD Pipelines**
   - Regularly test every code change to identify defects in real time. Employ containerized environments for consistent testing.

### 4. **Exploratory Testing**
   - Uncover usability flaws through dynamic, ad-hoc testing.
