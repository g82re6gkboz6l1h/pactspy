## How AI is Transforming Software QA

Software QA traditionally involved manual tasks such as creating test cases, identifying bugs, and ensuring system stability, which became difficult to scale as systems grew more complex. Today, AI and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing workflows by automating processes, improving scalability, accelerating testing, and increasing accuracy.

AI-powered tools automatically analyze codebases, generate test cases, predict bugs, and simulate user behavior far beyond human capacity. These technologies ensure faster iterations and higher-quality releases, lowering the risk of costly production errors.
