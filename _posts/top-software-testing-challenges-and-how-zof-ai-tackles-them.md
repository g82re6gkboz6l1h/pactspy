## Common Software Testing Challenges Developers Face

Modern development practices like agile and DevOps have increased the need for faster, more dynamic testing. However, software testing teams often encounter these hurdles:

1. **Limited Testing Time**  
   Agile methodologies demand shorter release cycles, and manual testing slows the pace, risking project delays.

2. **Insufficient Test Coverage**  
   Complex applications often leave edge cases untested, potentially causing system failures.

3. **Big Data Complexity**  
   Applications relying on large datasets face challenges in thorough testing using traditional techniques.

4. **Flaky Test Cases**  
   Inconsistent test results from flaky cases hamper productivity and require constant maintenance.

5. **Microservices Integration Bottlenecks**  
   Integration testing across distributed systems is resource-heavy and prone to errors.

6. **Continuous Testing Challenges**  
   Real-time, scalable testing pipelines are indispensable in modern workflows, which manual or conventional testing struggles to meet.
