# The Future of Software Testing: Hyperautomation and AI in 2025

Software testing is undergoing a major transformation as hyperautomation—a blend of AI, machine learning (ML), robotic process automation (RPA), and intelligent workflows—becomes a driving force. By 2025, hyperautomation will redefine testing efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness across industries.

## What is Hyperautomation in Software Testing?
Hyperautomation refers to automating complex, repeatable testing tasks using advanced technologies. Instead of replacing human testers, it enhances their ability to focus on strategic priorities in quality assurance (QA). AI-enabled hyperautomation in testing leads to faster cycles, reduced errors, and significant cost savings.
