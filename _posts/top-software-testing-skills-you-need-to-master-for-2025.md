## Why Software Testing Skills Are Rapidly Changing

Decades ago, software testing largely revolved around manual test case execution. Today, however, the industry demands integration with continuous integration/continuous development (CI/CD) pipelines, advanced automation techniques, and an immersive focus on end-user experience. Technologies like IoT, edge computing, and cloud platforms have added layers of complexity to testing. 

With the rapid adoption of AI and ML, QA teams must now embrace predictive testing, faster defect detection, and tools that work autonomously, such as [Zof AI](https://zof.ai). These trends are why cultivating the right skills is key for testers to remain at the forefront of innovation.
