## New Horizons in Software Testing Methodologies

As the software industry shifts towards continuous development, outdated approaches to testing are fast becoming relics. Traditional waterfall-style testing, performed late in development cycles, has been replaced with agile, DevOps, and CI/CD methodologies, highlighting the need for testing at every development phase. 

By 2025, the introduction of intelligent testing methods—powered by AI—has set a new benchmark. AI automates tasks that once required manual effort, such as risk assessment, test generation, and management of self-healing scripts, revolutionizing testing strategies. Emerging platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) exemplify this innovation by streamlining complex testing processes through predictive analytics and NLP-powered automation.

### What Is Intelligent Testing?
Intelligent testing leverages AI to enable:
- Risk-based testing, focusing on areas prone to failure.
- Automated test generation driven by natural language processing.
- Self-healing scripts that adapt to codebase updates.

These integrations save time and reduce costs, ultimately redefining software quality assurance.
