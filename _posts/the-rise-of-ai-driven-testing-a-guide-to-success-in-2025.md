## What Is AI-Driven Testing, and Why Is It a Game-Changer?

AI-driven testing leverages AI and machine learning to streamline software quality assurance (QA). Unlike traditional testing, which relies heavily on manual interventions, AI automates repetitive tasks, predicts defects, and adapts to constantly evolving codebases. It ensures applications are ready for real-world scenarios in less time and with greater accuracy.

One standout example is how AI algorithms can simulate user interactions and detect bugs in real-time—no more painstaking scripting or waiting for manual reviews. With AI, QA teams can execute thousands of test cases in minutes, providing an unparalleled improvement in speed and precision.
