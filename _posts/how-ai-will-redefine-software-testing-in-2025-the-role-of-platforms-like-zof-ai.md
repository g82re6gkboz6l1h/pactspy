## The Journey of AI in QA Testing

Quality assurance has continuously adapted to tackle more complex systems. Traditionally, QA relied on manual efforts, with testers identifying bugs through intuition. The introduction of automation in the 2000s transformed repetitive tasks such as regression testing. However, automation tools often fall short in handling rapidly changing systems. AI disrupts this limitation by introducing intelligence and self-learning mechanisms. Platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) not only adapt to ever-evolving systems but also generate dynamic test cases on the go.

### AI-Driven QA Testing Milestones
- **2010s:** Initial adoption of machine-learning-based defect prediction.
- **2020s:** AI-generated test cases and self-healing UI tests revolutionize the industry.
- **2025 and Beyond:** Predictive analytics and full-scale automation across regression, UI, and performance testing redefine QA.
