## Biggest QA Testing Obstacles

### 1. Test Coverage Limitations
QA teams struggle to cover all scenarios, paths, or edge cases due to resource and time constraints. Missing these could lead to undetected bugs and poor user experience.

### 2. Complex Error Diagnosis
Tracking errors to their root cause in large systems is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, often involving multiple teams and prolonged debugging sessions.

### 3. Scalability Issues
As software applications evolve, traditional QA methods fall short in dealing with increasing complexity and size, especially with semi-automated or manual testing.

### 4. Tight Deadlines
Fast-paced development cycles in agile methodologies can outpace manual testing processes, reducing the time allocated for QA.

### 5. Skill Gaps
Continuous advancement in QA tools and automation leaves teams unable to keep up without proper training and expertise.

Each of these hurdles calls for modernized approaches. This is where AI-driven platforms like Zof AI make a difference.
